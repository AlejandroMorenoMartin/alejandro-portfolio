  "artisteoSubParagraph1Title":"First look",
  "artisteoSubParagraph1Text":"The research process for this project entailed market study, user interviews, hypothesis validation and usability testing. As the lead designer on the project, I developed a research approach that integrates various methodologies to explore and refine new skills. With the support of my team, I conduct needs assessments and usability testing to deliver user-centered solutions.",  
  "artisteoSubParagraph1Text3":"Goals",
  "artisteoSubParagraph1Text4":"Understand the needs and behaviors of the target users.",
  "artisteoSubParagraph1Text5":"Identify pain points and challenges in the current experience.",
  "artisteoSubParagraph1Text6":"Validate hypotheses about user expectations.",
  "artisteoSubParagraph1Text7":"Evaluate the usability and accessibility of the proposed design.",
  "artisteoSubParagraph1Text8":"Gather insights to iterate and improve the final product.",
  "artisteoSubParagraph2Title":"Value proposition",
  "artisteoSubParagraph2Text":"Artisteo centralizes the experience for users and artists. Users can browse a catalog of music artists, view their work, easily contact and book them, as well as access ratings and details such as technical rider and availability. For artists, the platform offers an intuitive process to register, increase their visibility and access new job opportunities, all in an environment that fosters professional growth.",
  "artisteoSubParagraph3Title":"MVP development",
  "artisteoSubParagraph3Text":"From ideation to execution, Artisteo's MVP development focused on creating a user-friendly and scalable platform, prioritizing user needs and a clear visual design. The process involved constant collaboration between team members to ensure the final product was functional and aligned with the project goals.",
  "artisteoParagraph2Title":"Research",
  "artisteoSubParagraph4Title":"Market study",
  "artisteoSubParagraph4Text":"In this phase we investigated the theory around the creation of marketplaces, recruitment strategies, monetization and protection. We looked at some of the best established ones to see what they do and how they do it. We also explored some that have achieved success more recently and some with very good prospects for the future. This study helped identify best practices and areas for improvement, ensuring that Artisteo would provide a unique and competitive solution.",
  "artisteoSubParagraph5Title":"User interviews",
  "artisteoSubParagraph5Text":"We conducted interviews with two key profiles: artists and contractors. Artists were asked about their needs and challenges when promoting their work and securing job opportunities. Contractors shared their expectations when looking for artists for events and how easily they wanted to contact and hire them. The interviews provided valuable insights into the motivations and frustrations of both groups, allowing us to focus the MVP design on addressing their problems effectively.",
  "artisteoSubParagraph6Title":"Hypothesis validation",
  "artisteoSubParagraph6Text":"Throughout the research, we proposed several hypotheses about what users needed from the platform. These hypotheses were validated through surveys and interviews, and the results allowed us to confirm or adjust our assumptions. For example, we discovered that the ability to easily view artists' work and access reviews was crucial for users, which reaffirmed our design direction.",
  "artisteoSubParagraph7Title":"Usability testing",
  "artisteoSubParagraph7Text":"The usability test aims to validate the hypotheses made in the previous point and to obtain key information that will allow us to build the MVP. We chose the two main profiles (contractors and artists). We used Meets for communications and the Figma prototype for interactions with the product. For this we gave the participants a series of tests that we asked them to complete.",
  "artisteoParagraph3Title":"Design decisions",
  "artisteoParagraph3Text":"The information obtained from the research shows that the platform has two distinct types of customers with different requirements. The design decisions translate these requirements into concrete functions and features that allow users to satisfy those needs.",

  "artisteoParagraph5Text4":"centralize documentation, communications and contracts in a single space",
  "artisteoSubParagraph8Title":"Bidirectional platform",
  "artisteoSubParagraph8Text":"The platform needs to offer a personalized experience for both profiles: artists and contractors. This means having exclusive sections for each, ensuring that artists have tools to manage their visibility and offers, while contractors can easily explore and hire artists.",
  "artisteoSubParagraph9Title":"Profile creation",
  "artisteoSubParagraph9Text":"The artist sign-up process must be fast and simple. We've designed a profile creation flow that is not only easy to follow but also quick, allowing artists to start showcasing their work as soon as possible without complications.",
  "artisteoSubParagraph10Title":"Artist search and filtering",
  "artisteoSubParagraph10Text":"Search and filtering artists is one of the most important features for contractors. We decided to implement an easy-to-use search system with clear filters that allow users to find artists based on their specific needs (music genre, location, availability, etc.).",
  "artisteoSubParagraph11Title":"Artist profile",
  "artisteoSubParagraph11Text":"It's essential that users can access all relevant information about an artist in a clear and easy-to-understand way. Each artist profile should include details such as previous work, ratings from other users, availability, and contact info, all displayed in an intuitive manner to make it easier for contractors to make decisions.",
  "artisteoSubParagraph12Title":"Help center",
  "artisteoSubParagraph12Text":"We ensured the platform provides assistance to both user profiles at all times, ensuring that both artists and contractors can complete their tasks without difficulties. This includes everything from brief tutorials to interface elements that guide users through the profile creation and hiring processes.",
  "artisteoParagraph4Title":"Design system",
  "artisteoParagraph4Text":"As the sole designer on the project and with the intention of iterating and building the MVP as quickly as possible, I focused my time and effort on building a small design system that would ensure visual consistency, allow us to work efficiently with development, be scalable and allow us to continuously improve the design.",
  "artisteoSubParagraph13Title":"Brand creation",
  "artisteoSubParagraph13Text":"The brand was created with a focus on conveying professionalism, accessibility, and creativity. The logo reflects these values and is designed to be easily recognizable and adaptable to various sizes and applications. I was inspired by the idea of a triangle, as a way to symbolize the 3 parts that make up the marketplace. On one side the artists, on the other side the contractors and on the other side us as an organization.",
  "artisteoSubParagraph14Title":"Colors",
  "artisteoSubParagraph14Text":"The color palette was carefully selected to offer an attractive and consistent visual experience. We used tones that evoke trust and professionalism, while accent colors help guide user attention and highlight important actions within the platform.",
  "artisteoSubParagraph15Title":"Typography",
  "artisteoSubParagraph15Text":"Typography was chosen to ensure readability and consistency across all devices. We selected fonts that balance modernity and clarity, with sizes and hierarchies that improve reading experience and navigation.",
  "artisteoSubParagraph16Title":"Icons",
  "artisteoSubParagraph16Text":"The icons were designed to be intuitive and easy to understand. Each icon has a clear purpose and complements the platform's functionality, helping users navigate more efficiently.",
  "artisteoSubParagraph17Title":"Components",
  "artisteoSubParagraph17Text":"The component system includes all reusable UI elements, such as buttons, forms, cards, and menus.

  "artisteoParagraph6Title":"Learnings",
  "artisteoSubParagraph19Text":"One of the most significant lessons from this project is the importance of taking action and keeping momentum. When building something from scratch, it's crucial not to get bogged down in theoretical discussions or endless planning. Instead, you need to push forward, make decisions, and iterate as you go. Progress comes from actively engaging with the challenges, testing ideas, and learning from each step",
