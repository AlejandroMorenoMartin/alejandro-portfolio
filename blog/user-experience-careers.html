          <p class="regular">If your goal is to land a job as a UX designer, it's a good idea to understand important aspects of the industry. It's a field that is constantly evolving, and in recent years, it has become a highly sought-after position in the Tech sector.</p>
          <p class="regular">"UX designer" is the commonly used term for the position, although within this role, there are different figures and specific positions that cover various aspects of the product design process.</p>
          <p class="regular">In this article, you will learn about these <b>different positions and their responsibilities within a company</b>.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="article-container__paragraph">
          <h3>Interaction designer</h3>
          <p class="regular">They focus on the user experience and product functions. Their efforts revolve around
            understanding the user flow, or the path users take to complete different tasks in a mobile application or
            website.</p>
          <p class="regular">They ask questions like: What happens if the user presses this button? How are different
            design elements distributed within the website?</p>
        </div>
        <div class="article-container__paragraph">
          <h3>Visual designer</h3>
          <p class="regular">They concentrate on how the product looks. They are responsible for logos, illustrations,
            icons, color, typography, sizes, and the positioning of different elements. They ha ndle the design of each
            page and ensure that all elements are arranged in the most apparent way possible.</p>
          <p class="regular">They answer questions like: What visual style should the icons have to align with the brand
            design? What color and font should this button have?</p>
        </div>
        <div class="article-container__paragraph">
          <h3>Motion designer</h3>
          <p class="regular">They think about how users feel when navigating the product and how to create smooth
            transitions between different pages. They are also in charge of creating animations and visual effects that
            bring ideas to life.</p>

            transitions between different pages. They are also in charge of creating animations and visual effects that
            bring ideas to life.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="article-container__paragraph">
          <h3>VR/AR Designer</h3>
          <p class="regular">Virtual reality and augmented reality are fields where designers are also specializing.
            They focus on creating immersive experiences without the limitations of the physical world. Virtual reality
            involves users' vision being controlled by a wearable headset, blocking out their external space and
            immersing them in a virtual world. It gives the user the feeling of being in an imaginary place.</p>
          <p class="regular">On the other hand, augmented reality uses physical space to add virtual elements in an
            overlay, allowing both worlds to be available simultaneously. For example, you could be in your kitchen, and
            through augmented reality, images like a new stool or a piece of art could be added and appear around you.
          </p>
          <p class="regular">They answer questions like: How can we create experiences that make the most of space and
            provide a 3D sensation? They must pay special attention to light and sound to make the experience as real as
            possible.</p>

            products can solve those problems.</p>
          <p class="regular">They also study usability in real products, asking users to complete different tasks in an
            application or website. They answer questions like: What problems are users facing? Is the design of this
            product easy to use?</p>
          <p class="regular">The goal of researchers is to understand how a product can offer a solution to a real
            problem that users are facing.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="article-container__paragraph">
          <h3>UX writer</h3>

            They also help define the brand image and the personality it should have. Their work usually includes
            writing labels for buttons that determine the tone of language used within the product.</p>
          <p class="regular">They focus on answering questions like: What words should I use to communicate this idea in
            the best possible way? Should the tone of this product be friendly or technical?</p>

            improve processes for the team?. They work with all departments, ensuring that project objectives are met
            and helping to solve any problems that may arise.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="article-container__paragraph">
          <h3>UX engineer </h3>
          <p class="regular">They translate designs into functional experiences. They help design teams figure out how
            to address technical issues that may arise during the creation or development process.</p>
          <p class="regular">They answer questions like: How can we implement this interaction? How can we develop this
            design to match the original design? They are responsible for synthesizing design and development, making
            concepts come to life.</p>
        </div>

          <p class="regular">They are responsible for incorporating naturalness and patterns of human behavior into
            interactions between products and users. They answer questions like: What would be the ideal language
            depending on the type of user and the task they need to perform? Should the virtual assistant's personality
            convey a specific emotion?</p>
