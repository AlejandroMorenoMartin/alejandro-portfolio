        <p class="regular">The product design industry encompasses a variety of business types, each offering unique
          advantages and challenges. Understanding these differences can help designers choose the best path for their
          careers. Here, we explore the pros and cons of five major business types in the product design sector:
          startups, large companies, design agencies, advertising agencies, and freelancers.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div id="section-1" class="main-3__article-sections-section">
        <div class="main-3__article-section-header">
          <p class="large">Startups</p>
        </div>
        <p class="regular"><b>Advantages</b><br>Startups are known for their agility and innovation. Designers in
          startups often have the freedom to experiment and iterate rapidly, which fosters creativity and quick
          problem-solving. The dynamic environment allows designers to take on diverse roles, gaining broad experience
          and skill sets. Additionally, the close-knit nature of startup teams can lead to a strong sense of camaraderie
          and direct impact on the product.
        </p>
        <p class="regular"><b>Disadvantages</b><br>The major drawback is the high level of uncertainty and risk.
          Startups often operate with limited resources and tight budgets, which can lead to high-pressure situations
          and job instability. The fast-paced environment might also result in long hours and work-life balance
          challenges.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div id="section-2" class="main-3__article-sections-section">
        <div class="main-3__article-section-header">
          <p class="large">Large companies</p>
        </div>
        <p class="regular"><b>Advantages</b><br>Large companies offer stability and extensive resources. Designers have
          access to advanced tools, substantial budgets, and comprehensive market data. Working in a large corporation
          provides opportunities for specialization and career growth, often accompanied by formal training programs and
          mentorship.
        </p>
        <p class="regular"><b>Disadvantages</b><br>The bureaucratic structure of large companies can slow down the
          design process. Multiple layers of approval and rigid protocols may stifle creativity and innovation.
          Designers might also find their roles more narrowly defined, which can limit exposure to different aspects of
          the design process.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div id="section-3" class="main-3__article-sections-section">
        <div class="main-3__article-section-header">
          <p class="large">Design agencies</p>
        </div>
        <p class="regular"><b>Advantages</b><br>Design agencies offer a variety of projects and clients, providing
          designers with diverse experiences and the opportunity to work on a wide range of products. The collaborative
          environment fosters creativity and learning from peers. Agencies often emphasize high-quality design and
          staying current with industry trends.
        </p>
        <p class="regular"><b>Disadvantages</b><br>The fast-paced nature of agency work can lead to tight deadlines and
          high stress. The focus on client satisfaction might require frequent revisions and changes, which can be
          challenging. Job stability can also be less predictable compared to in-house positions, as agencies rely on a
          steady stream of clients and projects.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div id="section-4" class="main-3__article-sections-section">
        <div class="main-3__article-section-header">
          <p class="large">Advertising agencies</p>
        </div>
        <p class="regular"><b>Advantages</b><br>Advertising agencies provide designers with opportunities to work on
          high-visibility campaigns that can significantly impact brand perception. The work is often dynamic and
          fast-paced, keeping designers engaged and challenged. Collaboration with diverse teams, including marketers
          and strategists, can broaden a designer's perspective and skills.
        </p>
        <p class="regular"><b>Disadvantages</b><br>The primary focus on branding and marketing may limit the scope of
          product design work, leading to less involvement in the complete product development cycle. The emphasis on
          meeting client demands and tight deadlines can result in high-pressure situations and potential burnout.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div id="section-5" class="main-3__article-sections-section">
        <div class="main-3__article-section-header">
          <p class="large">Freelancers</p>
        </div>
        <p class="regular"><b>Advantages</b><br>Freelancers enjoy the flexibility to choose their projects and clients,
          offering control over their work-life balance and creative direction. The variety of projects can be
          enriching, allowing for constant learning and growth. Freelancing can also be financially rewarding, as
          designers can set their rates and work with multiple clients simultaneously.
        </p>
        <p class="regular"><b>Disadvantages</b><br>The biggest challenge for freelancers is the lack of job security and
          steady income. Finding and retaining clients requires continuous effort in networking and marketing.
          Freelancers must also manage all aspects of their business, including administration and finances, which can
          be time-consuming and divert focus from creative work.
